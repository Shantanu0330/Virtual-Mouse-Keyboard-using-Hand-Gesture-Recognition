# Virtual-Mouse-Keyboard-using-Hand-Gesture-Recognition

Aim & Objective:

  The purpose of this project is to develop a Virtual Mouse and Keyboard that 
targets a few aspects of significant development. For starters, this project aims to 
develop the alternative to a physical mouse and keyboard while being able to interact 
with the computer system through a webcam by using various Machine Learning (ML) 
models. Other than that, this project aims to develop a Virtual Mouse and Keyboard 
that can be operational on all kinds of surfaces and environments.

Applications and Uses:

• This technology is used for performing various mouse and keyboard operations 
like clicking events, scrolling, typing, etc. even without touching the physical 
mouse & keyboard.
• It can be used to reduce the spread of the pandemic since the proposed mouse 
& keyboard system can be used virtually using hand gestures without using the 
traditional physical mouse & keyboard.
• It can be used to help patients who don’t have control of their limbs & in 
operation theatres where low noise is essential.
• It can be used to control robots and automation systems without the usage of 
devices.
• It can be used to design 3-D models, architectural designs, automated buildings, 
etc.

Advantages:

• By applying Computer Vision technology, the virtual mouse & keyboard can
reduce the workspace required.
• No mechanical wear and tear as no wires or external devices are required. 
• Longer life span & Cost-effective.
• Mouse pad no longer required.
• Convenient for the users who are not comfortable with the touchpad.
